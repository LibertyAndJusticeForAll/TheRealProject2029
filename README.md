# TheRealProject2029
"Father and I went down to vote along with many millions,
  but there we found our vote don't count as much as those with billions.

Sister said it got that way a'cause of Gerrymander:
  some guy who tied the polls in knots so he could play commander. 

Yanke Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle Dandy,
  mind the music and the step, and with the Good be handy!"
(Revised lyrics to Yankee Doodle by Vector Hasting, see file on Yankee Doodle Lyrics for license to cover)

"Project 2029" is shorthand for the work that must begin now, and continue forever, to replace tyranny and authoritarianism with Liberty and Justice for All. 

We hope you will join to make this a collaboration out in the public that provides an agressive road-map to turn the United States back from the calamity that lies ahead.
