The goal of TheRealProject2029 (TRP2029) is to map for We The People a comprehensive set of strategies and demands to Restore and Protect Democracy, Liberty and Justice. We will abbreviate those goals as the "Project Goals 2029," or PG2029. 
(Or a better abbreviation someone can suggest and we can all agree on.)

Human resources will be a major challenge for PG2029, because many people still in government will be either 1) untrustworthy employees from the previous administration, or 2) tainted by association with them. 

By 2029, ICE is probably the most destroyed institution of the US government. 

By 2029 ICE will have committed numerous crimes: 
1) operating prisons with inhumane general conditions tantamount to torture,
2) actual torture through sexual and physical abuse by ICE agents of people in their custody, similar but worse than Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse,
3) actual murder of people in ICE custody, either first, or second, or third degree murder,
5) corruption, perhaps in the billions, due to access to unprecidented funds by unscruplous leaders with a demoralized workforce, 
6) collecting and holding information on US Citizens under color of authority to prosecute resistance to ICE's authority.

As a result, by 2029 ICE will have the popularity of radiactive waste. 

The Executive must not tolerate any erosion of its mandate to achieve PG2029, therefore it cannot use ICE in any capacity or risk being tarnished in the eyes of the public, and in the eyes of history, and in the actuality of corruption. 

Therefore, the Executive must find a replacement for the border control duties of ICE. 

This will requires appropriately trained manpower that is also politically un-affiliated with the abuses of ICE. 

There will be a small number of ICE agents who have been left in administrative jobs during the abuses, and therefore potentially un-tainted by fieldwork. 
Reliably determining who these individuals are is a significant challenge in 2029


Therefore, and it will require 

Instead, the Executive must implement an immediate purge of ICE officials who are complicit in the crimes  while seeking Congress' approval to rename and reorganize ICE.
