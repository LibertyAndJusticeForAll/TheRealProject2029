The goal of TheRealProject2029 (TRP2029) is to map for We The People a comprehensive set of strategies and demands to Restore and Protect Democracy, Liberty and Justice. 
We will abbreviate those goals as the "Project Goals 2029," or PG2029. 
(Or a better abbreviation someone can suggest and we can all agree on.)

The current Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has engaged in rulings at odds with the very constitution they claim to represent.  
For example, in Trump v. USA, they created an exclusive "Constitutional Right" for Presidents be immune from Criminal prosecution for "official acts." 
SCOTUS created this right despite the Constitution having no such language, and despite the fact that the Constitution speaks to immunity: but only for members of Congress, and only while engaged in legislative duties, and not in the case of Treason, Felony, or Violence. 
(See US Constitution, Article I, Section 6: "They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.")
For further example, in Citizen's United v. FEC they have extended first-amendment rights of freedom of speech to corporations.  
For further example, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby they have extended first-amendment rights of freedom of religion to corporations. 
Corporations are manifestly not humans, yet the first amendment seems most obviously to pertain to persons, and not to corporate entities. 
(See US Constitution, Amendment I: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.")
(Also, scan the US Constitution for mention of corporations, or joint-stock companies as they were known at the time, and there is no mention of them.)
These examples are not exhaustive. 
(It would be helpful for a better elucidation of examples of the politically motivated contraditions in recent SCOTUS rulings. See: https://afj.org/article/supreme-court-inconsistency-reveals-its-political-hypocrisy/ )

For these reasons, TRP2029 must anticipate that many of the laws we will pass for PG2029 will be struck down by SCOTUS. 

Nonetheless, we must pass them first as ways to advance two other necessary strategies for PG2029:
First: for each law that is struck down, we will need to replace them with constitutional amendments -- and these will have more justification if a corrupt self-serving court has struck down the equivalent laws. 
Second: we need to bolster the political case for expanding SCOTUS, implementing term limits for SCOTUS, and imposing ethics reforms on SCOTUS. 

The second strategy above may lead to another "Constitutional Crisis" as the sitting SCOTUS may well defend their support of Project 2025 by ruling some or all of the legislation aimed at reforming SCOTUS to be an unconstitutional infringement by the Legilative Branch on the Judicial Branch. 
If that happens, the second line of legislative attack for PG2029 will be to attempt to pass constitutional amendments that duplicate the laws SCOTUS struck down. 
In order to succeed, politicians in the service of PG2029 must wage a multi-decade struggle to complete a Constituional makeover of the USA.
That mission will be accellerated by relentless political focus on the injustice of SCOTUS' decisions to grant ever more power to the powerful, and on Justices' refusal to have sensible check upon their own power. 

For these reasons, every sub-folder in this folder "LegislationAndAmendments" has the subject being addressed (for example, "voting rights," or "corporate reform," or "data privacy rights") and contains within it two subfolders: one for laws, and another for constitutional amendments. 
It may be that some folders contain only a stub indicating why the law or amendment is not there. 
It may be that there is no conceivable way for the law to be ruled unconstitutional, and in that case the amendment folder will have no amendment. 
It may be that there is no conceivable way for a law to be ruled constitutional, and in that case the law folder will have no law. 
It may also be that one or the other version still needs to be written. 
This may be because the laws or
